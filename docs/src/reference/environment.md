# Environment

`.venv` is already active. Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt`; install
with `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/world-uv-cache uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt`.
Building ExoPlaSim needs `gcc-fortran` and `openmpi` from the host (Arch).
Matplotlib is forced to `Agg` with its cache at `/tmp/world-matplotlib-cache`.

**ExoPlaSim is installed EDITABLE from its subtree, not from PyPI**, so a build
compiles in place and `requirements.txt` deliberately does not name it:

    uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e vendor/exoplasim

What the fork contains and where it came from is in [the vendored upstreams](vendored-upstreams.md).

Two things about the model are worth knowing before you touch it. Several
changes are NO-OPS until a namelist key turns them on -- `h2osww` defaults to
1.0, `ndustrad` to 0, `nsolcycle` to 0 -- so a rebuilt binary reproduces the runs
that exist, and enabling one is a configuration decision that moves the mean.
And the low-I/O change ALTERS THE RESTART LAYOUT, so a run started before it
cannot be resumed by a binary built after it.

The stellar cycle is one of those switches rather than a separate build. There
is no cycle executable and no cycle tree: `nsolcycle` defaults to 0 and both
amplitudes to 0.0, which reduces the guard to `gsolinst = gsol0`, so the
ordinary binaries are bit-exact identical to an unpatched model until a cycle is
configured on.
