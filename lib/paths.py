"""Path display helpers shared across components.

One function, and it exists because of a specific recurring bug.

`Path.relative_to` RAISES when the path is not under the given root. Every script
here prints "wrote <path>" relative to the project root, and that print happens
*after* the artifact has been written. So passing `--output` to somewhere outside
the tree -- /tmp, a scratch directory, an absolute path typed by hand -- writes
the file correctly and then dies with a ValueError, leaving an artifact on disk
and a traceback on the terminal that looks like the run failed.

`pedology/scripts/build_soil.py` hit this and left a soil map with no provenance
record. It was then fixed at one of its two call sites and not the other, which
is the more instructive half of the story: the fix has to be applied everywhere
the pattern appears, not just where it was first observed. See
`notes/failure-modes.md`.

Provenance records have the same problem for a different reason: a path recorded
as absolute is not portable, and a path that raises is worse than either.

    Read from `config/planet.yaml`'s `baseline_climatology`, with no fallback,
    because a fallback here is the most expensive kind of bug this project has:
    it returns a plausible number computed from a different world instead of an
    error. The default it replaced pointed at `climatology_s096`, which is
    pre-carve terrain under the superseded `k2` spectrum and the surface the
    antipodal carve verdict was taken from.

    It lives in `lib/` because copies of it did not stay in step. pedology and
    biosphere were migrated to the config key; `surface_water.py` kept a private
    module constant, and `build_surface_albedo.py` and
    `build_surface_soil_water.py` kept an argparse default, all three still
    naming the superseded directory. Two of those only surfaced when a
    re-baseline ran them for the first time in months.

    Returns the FILE. Callers must not rebuild the name from a directory: the
    label is chosen per product, so a bootstrap climatology is
    `bootstrap_regular_climatology.nc` and reconstructing
    `baseline_regular_climatology.nc` beside it finds nothing.

    `name` still accepts a directory under `exoplasim/analysis/` for the old
    layout, so existing callers that pass one keep working.
