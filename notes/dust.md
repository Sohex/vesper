# Dust: why the model cannot help, and why it matters anyway

## What ExoPlaSim has

Aerosols are **off**: `L_AERO = 0` in every run this project has made. An
`aero_namelist` is written into each run directory and is inert.

If enabled, `l_source = 2` selects dust, and the source term is
`aerocore.f90:625`:

    mmr(:,:,NLEV,ic) = fcoeff * land

A fixed mixing ratio in the bottom layer of every land gridbox, zero over ocean,
then advected. There is no wind-speed threshold, no soil-moisture gating, and no
weighting by surface type. `l_source = 1`, the default, is photochemical haze
rather than dust.

Real dust emission is violently nonlinear in precisely the terms this omits. It
scales steeply above a threshold friction velocity, shuts off when the surface is
wet or vegetated, and concentrates in a handful of source regions: the Bodele
Depression, a dry lake bed, supplies a large share of Earth's dust by itself.

**So enabling it here would add a bias rather than remove one.** On this planet
closed-basin fill is about a quarter of the land, and a uniform-over-land source
would emit as much from forest as from salt pan -- getting wrong the exact
distinction that makes dust interesting here. Representing it properly needs a
supplied source field, which means patching `aerocore` rather than setting a
namelist value.

## Why it matters anyway, and a correction

Dust is the return leg of the phosphorus cycle, and this project has so far only
described the outbound one.

The hydrological story is that phosphorus weathered from rock is carried by
runoff, and in a closed basin it never reaches the sea -- so endorheic drainage
traps P on basin floors and starves the uplands. That was stated here as though
it were the whole account. It is not.

Aeolian transport runs the other way. Dry lake beds are the most efficient dust
sources there are, and dust is a major phosphorus input to old, deeply weathered
soils whose own apatite is exhausted -- which is exactly what the wet parts of
this planet should be. On Earth the Amazon receives a significant share of its
phosphorus from Saharan dust, and the dominant single source is a dry lake bed.

So the loop is: **water moves phosphorus into the basins, wind moves it back
out.** The net depends on the balance of the two, and this world should sit
further along that loop than Earth does, because its playa and salt-crust
fraction is roughly an order of magnitude larger.

That also weakens, in the same direction, the conclusion that this planet should
show P-poor uplands against P-rich basin floors. The gradient is probably real
but shallower than the hydrology alone implies.

## Priced before deciding

The budget's own stopping rule says to refine an input when its plausible range
exceeds the effect of the last thing refined. So, a crude bound before building
anything, using scattering-aerosol forcing
`F = -tau * S/4 * beta * (1 - a_surface)^2 * land_fraction` at an upscatter
fraction of 0.20:

| dust AOD over land | over vegetation (a=0.20) | over playa (a=0.40) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.03, Earth-like | -0.46 K | -0.26 K |
| 0.10 | -1.53 K | -0.86 K |
| 0.30 | -4.60 K | -2.59 K |

Earth's global dust AOD is about 0.03 and this planet's closed-basin fill is
roughly ten times Earth's dust-source area, so 0.1 to 0.3 is not an extreme
bracket. **That puts dust above every item in the error budget except the
biosphere question**, which by the project's own rule makes it worth refining.

**And the sign is not uniform.** Dust is darker than salt crust and brighter than
vegetation, so it warms over its own source regions and cools elsewhere. That is
the decisive argument for modelling rather than declaring: a spatially varying
sign cannot be recorded as a bias direction the way the missing ocean heat
transport can. Either it is computed or it is unknown.

## Is the patch error-prone?

Less than it looks, because the parameters split cleanly.

The optics are **not** haze-locked: `l_aerorad = 1` reads extinction, scattering,
backscatter and asymmetry for both bands from a supplied `aerofile`, so mineral
dust is representable. Three of the four parameters are Earth-calibratable --
`apart` (dust effective radius, 1 to 2 microns, against a haze default of 5 nm),
`rhop` (2500 kg/m3 for mineral dust, against a default of 1000, which is water),
and the `aerofile` itself, band-averaged from published dust refractive indices
for this star's bands.

The fourth, `fcoeff`, sets the total loading and has no Vesper calibration. It
should be **bracketed rather than chosen**, anchored so that an Earth-like source
area gives Earth's dust AOD and then spanned across the playa-fraction ratio.
That is the same treatment `pedogenesis.yaml` gives every constant it cannot
verify.

Two simplifications that remain and should be stated wherever a number is
quoted: the scheme is monodisperse where real dust spans 0.1 to 20 microns, and
the source term has no wind-speed threshold even once it is weighted by surface
type.

## What to do

Not in the GCM. Model the aeolian phosphorus term the way the carve verdict and
the thermostat efficiency are modelled: outside the climate model, from its
climatology. Everything needed is already here -- the playa and salt-crust
distribution from lithology, surface winds and precipitation from the
climatology, and the basin-to-cell coupling matrix that already integrates
climate over catchments.

Two things that would need declaring rather than deriving, and should be
bracketed rather than guessed: the phosphorus content of basin fill, and an
emission efficiency. Both are Earth calibrations of the kind
`pedogenesis.yaml` already carries.

Separately unquantified: dust has a radiative effect as well as a chemical one.
Bright dust over dark ground cools and over ice warms, and a quarter of this
planet's land is a potential source. That belongs in the error budget as an
unpriced item rather than being assumed negligible.
