# What other models in this class do, and what is worth taking

*Written 2026-08-22. Claims about this tree are from reading it; claims about
each external model are from its published description or its source, cited
inline. Costs quoted for other models are what their own authors state, on their
own hardware, and are not benchmarks run here.*

Vesper is a fictional planet and this project simulates it. What follows
compares this project's machinery against the Earth system models of
intermediate complexity, the exoplanet general circulation models, and two
recent projects that sit between them, so the comparison is not run again. It
reaches no adoption decision. What it produces is a short list of formulations
worth taking and a shorter list of candidates that are now closed.

## 1. The two families do not overlap, and this stack is in the gap

Every EMIC in current use runs one planet. CLIMBER-X, CLIMBER-2, LOVECLIM, UVic
ESCM, Bern3D, cGENIE, MIROC-lite and DCESS are Earth-configured down to their
constants: none accepts a non-solar host spectrum, a non-Earth radius, or a
rotation rate outside a narrow tuning range. Paleogeography is the most any of
them varies.

Every model that does run other planets is an atmosphere with almost nothing
under it. ExoCAM, ROCKE-3D, LMD-G, the Met Office UM, Isca, Exo-FMS and stock
ExoPlaSim ship no carbon cycle, no soil model, no drainage network and no
dynamic global vegetation model between them.

ExoPlaSim is the only entry with a foot on both sides, and only just: its
glacier and carbon-silicate weathering modules exist, are off here, and carry
Earth constants when on. `notes/audits/dormant-exoplasim-modules.md` records
which.

## 2. Cost, in CPU-hours per 100 simulated years

The unit matters. Simulated years per day hides the core count, and these models
were measured on different machines with different core counts by different
people.

| model | configuration | CPU-h per 100 sim-yr | source |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| CLIMBER-X | 5 x 5 deg, full climate component | ~3.8 | 10,000 sim-yr/day on 16 CPUs, Willeit et al. (2022) |
| LOVECLIM 1.2 | all components active | ~4 | 100 yr in ~4 h CPU on one Xeon, Goosse et al. (2010) |
| this stack | ExoPlaSim T42 L10, 16 ranks, FP64 | ~76 | 77-93 s per 180.7-day orbit, measured here |
| BIG-MITgcm | SPEEDY L5 + MITgcm L25, CS32 | ~300 | stated directly, Moinat et al. (2026) |

UVic ESCM 2.10 states 4.6 to 11.5 hours per 100 years on a desktop without
naming a core count, so it cannot be placed in this column; on wall clock it
sits between LOVECLIM and this stack. ExoCAM's ~35,000 core-hours is per case
rather than per unit model time and does not convert.

Two readings follow, and they point in opposite directions.

**The EMIC advantage is structural and already spent.** CLIMBER-X is about
twenty times cheaper per simulated year than this stack, and the reason is that
it does not solve the primitive equations: a 2.5-D statistical-dynamical
atmosphere on a 5 degree grid parameterises the circulation a spectral core
computes. For Earth that is a good trade. Here the circulation is one of the
things being asked about, under 30 hour rotation and 32 degree obliquity, so it
cannot be a parameterisation fitted to Earth's.

**A three-dimensional ocean costs about four times.** That is the most useful
single number in the table for OCN-3. BIG-MITgcm carries 25 levels of
primitive-equation MITgcm at an atmospheric resolution comparable to T42 for
about four times this stack's cost per simulated year. cGENIE at 36 x 36 x 16
frictional-geostrophic is a far lighter object than that, so four times is a
pessimistic bound on the ocean plan rather than an estimate of it.

## 3. PALADYN, and the four formulations worth taking

PALADYN (Willeit and Ganopolski, 2016, `10.5194/gmd-9-3817-2016`) is CLIMBER-X's
land surface model. `references/INDEX.md` records it as read. It matters here
because `references/INDEX.md` already holds JULES as the coupled land-surface
precedent for LSHY, and JULES is CMIP-class; PALADYN is the same object built
for an EMIC, so it is the precedent at a throughput this project shares.

Its shape: nine surface types, five soil layers to 3.9 m with a 20 cm top layer,
one snow layer with prognostic temperature and density, 1-D heat diffusion with
explicit snowmelt and soil phase change, and vertical Darcy flow on
Clapp-Hornberger properties with a free-drainage lower boundary. Physics and
photosynthesis integrate implicitly at a 1 day step, vegetation and soil carbon
at 1 month.

### 3a. The saturated fraction is the other answer to GW-6

PALADYN does not resolve the valley-to-ridge water table gradient either. It
obtains the saturated area statistically, under TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby,
1979) as implemented by Niu et al. (2005):

    f_sat = f_sat_max * exp(-f_grad * z_grad)

`f_sat_max` comes from a compound topographic index; PALADYN takes it from
ETOPO1 through Stocker et al. (2014). Wetland fraction is set equal to `f_sat`
wherever the surface is snow free. Infiltration capacity is
`k_sat * (1 - f_sat)`, and runoff is saturation excess over `f_sat` plus
infiltration excess over the rest.

Two things about this are worth stating separately.

**It changes the quantity being asked for.** GW-6 declares the valley-to-ridge
gradient as sub-grid and measured it as unrecoverable at 15.19 km: the model's
water table is a function of recharge at Spearman -0.977 where the real one is
not at -0.156, and GW-23 sized the discarded relief at about three times the
signal being predicted. TOPMODEL carries that terrain control statistically
instead of resolving it, and it delivers a per-cell saturated FRACTION rather
than a per-cell DEPTH. A fraction is what WET-2's wetness classification,
SURF-7's discharge mask and LSHY-6's hydrologic mosaic actually consume. The
depth is the quantity that failed its bar; the fraction has not been tested here.

**The index is computable from the mesh this project already has.** PALADYN
needs ETOPO1 because CLIMBER-X has no sub-grid terrain. Here the 15.19 km region
mesh under a roughly 300 km T42 cell is exactly the population a compound
topographic index is computed over, and GRID-2 is already chartered to persist
the sub-grid distribution. A compound topographic index is not the same
quantity as GRID-2's hypsometry, since it needs upslope contributing area and
local slope rather than an elevation distribution, but both come off the same
mesh and the drainage side already exists in `hydrography`.

Two caveats, neither fatal. `f_sat` still keys on a grid-cell mean water table,
so it inherits whatever bias that mean carries. And PALADYN estimates its mean
water table directly from column volumetric water content rather than from a
lateral solve, which is a much cheaper object than this project's
Dupuit-Forchheimer solver and sidesteps the thing GW-3 and GW-22 found hard;
whether the two should be reconciled or kept as separate estimators is open.

### 3b. Snow compaction carries gravity, and this model has no compaction

PALADYN's snow density is prognostic. Fresh snow density is temperature
dependent after Anderson (1976), and self-loading compaction follows Kojima
(1967) as implemented by Pitman et al. (1991):

    d(rho_sn)/dt = 0.5 * g * rho_sn * w_sn / eta + P_s * (rho_fresh - rho_sn) / w_sn
    eta = eta_0 * exp(k_T * (T_0 - T_sn) + k_rho * rho_sn)

Metamorphism and the effect of melting are neglected.

The compaction term is linear in `g`. At 12.81 against 9.81 m/s2 it runs 1.306
times Earth's for the same load and viscosity, so this planet's simulated
snowpack densifies faster and sits thinner for the same water equivalent.

ExoPlaSim has no compaction at all. Snow density is the constant 330 kg/m3,
declared twice: `rhosnow` at `landmod.f90:73` and `CRHOSN` as a hardcoded
`parameter` at `icemod.f90:24`. Both are used the same way, as
`dsnowz * 1000 / rhosnow`, to convert water equivalent to physical thickness.
That thickness sets the snow thermal layer thicknesses `zsntop` and `zsnowz` in
`landmod`, and in `icemod` it sets the combined ice-plus-snow threshold at
`icemod.f90:591`. So the constant reaches surface albedo through snow cover
depth, the ground heat flux through layer thickness, and the sea ice diagnostic.

330 kg/m3 is a reasonable Earth seasonal-snowpack mean. It is an inherited Earth
constant of exactly the class `notes/audits/inherited-earth-constants.md`
catalogues, it is duplicated with one copy hardcoded beyond namelist reach, and
the mechanism that would make it differ here is one this model does not contain.
The direction is known and one-signed; the magnitude is not, because `eta`
depends on temperature and load and this world's snow temperatures are not
Earth's.

### 3c. A third acceleration, with its invalidity declared

PALADYN can run its vegetation and carbon modules at an artificial internal time
step of 1000 years or more. This is possible only because those components are
fully implicit. In that mode they are called once at the end of each simulated
year, on annually cumulated NPP and litterfall and annual mean decomposition
rates, and the model reaches near equilibrium in about 100 simulated years
instead of the 10,000 the natural timescales would require. 100 years is also
what the physical state needs, permafrost above all.

The paper then states what the mode cannot do: it does not apply to processes
intrinsically out of equilibrium, naming peatlands and inert permafrost carbon,
and getting those to a present state requires a transient run over at least one
glacial cycle.

That declaration is the part worth copying. This tree now has three devices in
the same class and one of them is unrun: `NCVEG` for vegetation carbon,
PALADYN's equilibrium spinup mode, and ExoPlaSim's own `newsnow` for land ice,
whose feedstock every glacier-enabled run here has written and nothing has read
(`notes/audits/dormant-exoplasim-modules.md` finding 5). CLIM-53 asks for a
verdict on the third. PALADYN is the worked example of the verdict's shape: not
whether the accelerator is correct, but what it is valid for and what has to be
integrated honestly instead.

### 3d. The code is reachable, and the licence is clean

CLIMBER-X is public at `cxesmc/climber-x` under GPL-3.0, with PALADYN in
`src/lnd/`. The tree has moved past the 2016 paper: lakes are implemented where
the paper calls them a placeholder, and there is now `weathering.f90`,
`dust_emis.f90`, `n2o_emis.f90` and water isotopes.

ExoPlaSim is GPL version 2 "or, at your option, any later version"
(`vendor/exoplasim/LICENSE.TXT` line 298). A GPL-3 combination is therefore
permitted, with the combined work under GPL-3. That answers the licence question
before it is asked, and it matters because LSHY-3's land column would live
inside `landmod.f90`.

The modules that map onto open rows are `soil_hydro.f90` and `surface_hydro.f90`
for LSHY-3, `soil_temp.f90` for LSHY-5, and `water_check.f90`, which is a water
conservation checker of roughly the shape LSHY-7 describes.

### 3e. What of PALADYN is NOT worth taking

**The vegetation.** TRIFFID with five plant functional types, against
LPJ-GUESS CNP. Not close, in the wrong direction.

**The methane fractions.** PALADYN emits methane as a constant fraction of
heterotrophic respiration wherever respiration is anaerobic, with a different
fraction per surface type. WET-6 already holds the fork's globally tuned
respiration ratios to a higher standard than that, requiring vertically resolved
substrate, temperature, saturation and redox state and retaining the tuned
ratios only as named Earth structural bounds. Adopting PALADYN's constant would
be a step down from a standard already set.

**The peat structure, as a design.** Acrotelm and catotelm after Kleinen et al.
(2012), transfer at a critical acrotelm carbon of 5 kgC/m2 after Wania et al.
(2009), areal expansion after Stocker et al. (2014) limited to 1 percent a year
with a minimum fraction seeding every cell. WET-4 and WET-9 already charter this
ground with vertical resolution PALADYN does not have. The citations are useful;
the design is not an upgrade.

**The uniform hydraulic defaults.** `k_sat`, `psi_sat` and the Clapp-Hornberger
`b` are global uniform values by default, with a texture and organic matter
formulation available in an appendix. This project has a lithology-derived soil,
so only the second path is relevant, and LSHY-1 already owns the property
contract.

## 4. BIG-MITgcm is the nearest peer, and two of its details are warnings

BIG-MITgcm (Moinat et al., 2026, `10.5194/gmd-19-4357-2026`,
`references/gmd-19-4357-2026.pdf`) is the only published model that made the
same architectural bet as this project. SPEEDY physics on the MITgcm core at
CS32, about 2.8 degrees, with a 25-level ocean, Winton thermodynamic sea ice, a
two-layer land model, BIOME4, pysheds runoff routing and a new shallow-ice
module. Coupling is asynchronous and offline: run the fast system to a steady
state, update the slow components, repeat until convergence. That is loop A, B
and C with different components in the slots.

Its convergence predicate is declared: fewer than 10 percent of land points
changing biome or total ice volume, and a surface energy imbalance below
0.2 W/m2. Five iterations were needed, each requiring several thousand simulated
years to reach that steady state.

**Its ice sheet module is nearly free.** MITgcmIS uses the shallow-ice
approximation with Glen's law at n = 3 and a Positive Degree Day surface mass
balance after Tsai and Ruan (2018), neglecting basal sliding, calving and basal
melt as unresolvable at that resolution. It costs about 1 CPU-hour per 40,000
years. Ice sheet flow is therefore a small component rather than a large one,
and its diffusivity carries `(rho_i * g)^n` explicitly, which is the term
GRAV-6 discusses at 2.23x here. GRAV-6's objection stands unchanged, that a
`g^3` velocity applied to an Earth-calibrated ice mask is precision on the wrong
quantity; what is new is a published formulation of the whole equation rather
than a term to bolt on.

**Its cloud albedo is tuned on latitude for agreement.** The description is
explicit: cloud albedo depends on latitude in order to reduce net solar
radiation at high latitudes and therefore to agree better with observational
data. That is a fitted knob on a radiative quantity in a peer-reviewed model
description, and it is what `docs/src/practice/failure-modes.md` class 16
forbids by name. Anything borrowed from a SPEEDY-derived scheme carries it.

**Its bathymetry preparation deletes closed water.** Isolated oceanic points and
lakes are removed irrespective of size to avoid numerical instability, and every
point shallower than 20 m is set to 20 m. On a world where about three quarters
of land drainage is endorheic, a preparation step that silently removes enclosed
water is not a detail. OCN-11 already requires bathymetric smoothing and
connectivity changes to be declared explicitly; this is that requirement
justified by an observed case.

Two of its stated limitations validate diagnoses already made here. Its coarse
grid underestimates Greenland and Antarctic elevation and runs those regions too
warm, which is GRID-2 and PHYS-13's sub-grid orography problem found
independently at a comparable resolution. And its thermodynamic-only sea ice
produces excessive ice, which is the configuration this stack also runs.

Its atmosphere resolves longwave in four bands against this model's Sasamori
broadband plus the one added trace-gas band. On radiation this peer is ahead,
and it points the same way `exoplasim/notes/corrk-cross-check.md` does.

## 5. CliMA is not a competitor and has one thing worth reading

The Climate Modeling Alliance is writing a full Earth system model in Julia for
GPUs: `ClimaAtmos.jl`, `ClimaOcean.jl` on Oceananigans, `ClimaLand.jl`,
`ClimaSeaIce` and `ClimaCoupler.jl`, with correlated-k radiation in
`RRTMGP.jl`. Every one of those repositories had commits within the month of
this survey. It is CMIP-class, so its throughput is three to four orders below
the band this project works in, and nothing in that regime can carry a terrain
loop.

What is worth reading is `ClimaParams.jl`. It carries a block headed *Planetary
and Orbital Parameters (Earth Defaults)*: `planet_radius`,
`gravitational_acceleration`, `angular_velocity_planet_rotation`,
`length_orbit_semi_major`, `total_solar_irradiance`, `orbit_obliquity_at_epoch`,
`orbit_eccentricity_at_epoch` and a longitude of perihelion. That is
structurally `config/planet.yaml`, including the decision to name Earth's values
as defaults rather than compile them in. No EMIC has anything like it, and it is
an externally maintained enumeration of exactly the quantities OCN-12's
implicit-Earth audit is looking for.

`RRTMGP.jl` also treats the stellar source function as data rather than a
constant, though its correlated-k tables are trained on Earth-like gas mixtures
over Earth-like abundance ranges.

## 6. Candidates this survey closes

**A resolved-tier ocean in the model tree.** `lsgmod.f90` ships with ExoPlaSim
and is doubly off: `compile.sh:305` exports `OCEANCOUP=cpl_stub`, so every
coupling call reaches an empty return, and the full LSG source in `lsg/src/` is
never built. OCN-3 removed the resolved tier on spin-up cost and a coarse
geostrophic ocean does not escape that argument.
`notes/audits/dormant-exoplasim-modules.md` records this so it is not
rediscovered as an available option; nothing in this survey reopens it.

**A GPU port of the spectral transform.** Priced and parked under CLIM-58 on
this machine's arithmetic. CliMA is the existence proof of the other answer,
which is to design for GPUs from the first line and treat mixed precision as a
modelling decision. That is a rewrite rather than an optimisation and is not on
this project's table.

**Vendoring PALADYN whole.** A fourth subtree is a maintenance commitment, and
the Earth configuration inside it is the OCN-12 problem in a new place: uniform
hydraulic defaults, an ETOPO1 topographic index, calibrated methane fractions
per surface type. The formulations in section 3 are the valuable part and they
are all in the paper.
