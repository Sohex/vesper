"""Preflight: does everything in tree describe the same world?

Run this before an expensive run and after changing `source_build`. It exists
because the same class of error kept arriving by different routes, and every
instance was silent: array shapes matched, fields looked plausible, and the
answer was wrong.

    python scripts/check_consistency.py

Exit status is 0 when everything agrees, 1 when something disagrees. Warnings
report things that are stale but harmless to the active configuration.

## What it checks, and which bug each one is for

**Terrain hash across artifacts.** Every product carrying a `terrain_hash` must
match the configured build. The carve verdict once ran with one terrain's basins
and another's coupling matrix and raised an IndexError purely because the counts
differed; had they matched it would have paired row *i* of one build with row *i*
of another and produced a number.

**Stale flat data directories.** Hydrography is per-build now. A leftover
`<component>/data/*.nc` from an earlier build is not an error, but it is what
`world_state.py` was reading when it reported 2,107 basins for a build with
2,540.

**Coupling convention.** `coupling_*.nc` must carry `cell_lon`. Without it the
longitude convention cannot be checked, and the matrix numbers its columns
-180..180 while an ExoPlaSim climatology numbers its own 0..360. Every basin read
its antipode for an entire iteration.

**Surface inputs present and current.** Every code the config says it supplies
must exist, and must not predate the build it claims to describe.

**Carve list completeness.** A list sent to Orogen must cover the whole
catalogue with unique ids, and its carried-forward entries must all be retain 0,
since the loop is only monotone if an already-carved basin stays carved.

**Config internal consistency.** Gravity against mass, and the declared orbit
against the flux it is derived from.
